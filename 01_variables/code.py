# python reads variable assignment from right to left

x = 15 # int
price = 9.99 # float
discount = 0.2 # float

result = price * (1 - discount)

# this is a function that prints a variable on console
# functions are things that perform actions or calculate outputs (or both)
print(result)

# strings

print(name)

# changing variable values

a = 25

print(a)
print(b)

b = 17 # doesn't change a's value
